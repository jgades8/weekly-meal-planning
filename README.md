# weekly-meal-planning
This project creates a meal plan based on number of dinners and number of lunches input by the user.

Note: This project is very much in progress, but my goal is to build something useful and also learn some SQL.

# Requirements
The only requirement to run this program is Python.

# Improvement Ideas/TODO
    - Specify days of the week
    - Limit number of repeat proteins (ex. may days of 2-3 with chicken)
    - Limit number of repeat cuisines
    - Allow users to input preferences and filter accordingly (ex. vegetarian, no pork)
    - Don't repeat from previous week
    - add max level of difficulty
    - this could run into difficulties with large number of dinners where there is no solution
        - maybe add a max number of dinners or lunches??
