# weekly-meal-planning

# Improvement ideas 
    - Let user specify option they definitely want
    - Specify days of the week
    - Let user replace option
    - Function to list all of certain type of cuisine
    - limit number of repeat proteins (ex. may days of 2-3 with chicken)
    - limit number of repeat cuisines
    - sort grocery list by food type
    - allow users to input preferences and filter accordingly (ex. vegetarian, no pork)
    - don't repeat from previous week

# TODO:
    - create separate validate function
    - handle dinners not as int
    - sort dinners by number of lunches (ex. start with high leftover dinner, then no leftover etc)
