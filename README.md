# weekly-meal-planning
This project creates a meal plan based on number of dinners and number of lunches input by the user.

Note: This project is very much in progress, but my goal is to build something useful and also learn some SQL.

# Requirements
The only requirement to run this program is Python.

# Improvement Ideas/TODO
    - Let user specify option they definitely want
    - Specify days of the week
    - Let user replace option
        - Add more user options in general
    - Function to list all of certain type of cuisine
    - Limit number of repeat proteins (ex. may days of 2-3 with chicken)
    - Limit number of repeat cuisines
    - Sort grocery list by food type
    - Allow users to input preferences and filter accordingly (ex. vegetarian, no pork)
    - Don't repeat from previous week
